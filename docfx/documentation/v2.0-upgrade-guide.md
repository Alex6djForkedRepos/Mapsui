# v2.0 upgrade guide

This is the far from complete upgrade guide from v1.4 to v2.0. 
The most apparent changes will be mentioned here. If you notice 
important things missing then please post an issue.

### .NET Standard 2.0
Look up compatible frameworks in [this table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support).

### Viewport moved from Map to MapControl and is readonly
Use MapControl.Navigator instead.

### The NavigateTo methods moved to MapControl.Navigator
All user map manipulation should go the the Navigator. 

### Map.PanLock, Map.ZoomLock and map.RotationLock 
The lock fields can be used on all platforms to lock the user from 
a certain kind of map manipulation.

### Added Map.Limiter to limit the extent to which the user can navigate

### RefreshGraphics, RefreshData and Refresh
- Use RefreshGraphics if you know the data has changed and the graphics needs refreshing.
- Use RefreshData if you know there is new data available in the source.
- Use Refresh if you need to do both.

### Rename BoundingBox.GetCentroid to Centroid

### Rename IGeometry.GetBoundingBox to BoundingBox

### The Info event was moved from Map to MapControl

### Remove the InfoLayer list and add an InfoLayer boolean on ILayer
