# Samples
There are quite a few samples in Mapsui. They are the primary way to find you way around in Mapsui

## The code samples
The code for each sample can be found in the folder: [Samples\Mapsui\Mapsui.Samples.Common\Maps](https://github.com/pauldendulk/Mapsui/tree/master/Samples/Mapsui.Samples.Common/Maps).

## Run the samples
You can run the WPF sample app ([Mapsui.Samples.Wpf](https://github.com/pauldendulk/Mapsui/tree/master/Samples/Mapsui.Samples.Wpf)) in the samples folder to see them in action.
